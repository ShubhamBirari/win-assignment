# If you made an assumption, what are they?

### Purposely did not add the checkbox since it has not been used as shown in the Figma design.

### Used redux to implement state management.

### Not used localStorage hence every time we refresh the data will be lost.

### Since we are working with material design, makeStyles was used for CSS.

### Fetching the user details using an API. Thus on ever refresh, user detail will update.


# Outline what else needs to be done if more time is given?

### Using checkbox we can implement multi-delete functionality
